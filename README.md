TOP first project where we go over the basic HTML of a webpage and the different tags that are used.

## Methodology

The webiste is not heavily styled since the objectie for this project is going over the HTML structure of a webpage, I only applied CSS so it would have some order and easy accessibility  for any user that is browsing it.

The classes that are defined are for styling use only giving the webpage a uniform style once displayed.
